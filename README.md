# KeyBoard_Game
A game about practicing keyboard input.

I want to write a programme just for fun. I am learning WxPython about GUI.
You know, practicing keyboard input always is the first thing we must do to access to the computer world.
So, why don't I write something to help these who want to know the computer world.

The first time a computer was available to me, I was fifteen years old. Maybe I was much elder than most computer fans. It took me almost one month to practice keyboard input. It was pretty boring, I had to say. But, to be honest, I was good at keyboard input without looking at the keyboard after that month. I am always thankful.

Later, I would recommend several good software of keyboard input for my families. Some of these software are pretty good.  I love them, like a software from KingSoft.

However, now something is changing. I can write Python.
So, why don't I write a interesting software to practice keyboard input.

You know, I am on the way.
